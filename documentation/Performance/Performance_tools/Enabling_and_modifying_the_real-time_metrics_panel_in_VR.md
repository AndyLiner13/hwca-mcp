 The Real-time metrics panel is accessed from the Utilities menu, which can be enabled in Settings. To enable and view the Real-time metrics panel:
1. Visit a world in any mode.
2. Turn either of your wrists towards you to activate the wearable.
3. Open the PUI and open Settings.

hover your controller pointer over a metric with an empty check box, and pull the
trigger. The metric is added to the panel with a unique color identifier. If you attempt to select too many metrics, you receive a notification informing

## Real-time Metric Descriptions

 When [Frame Budget Boost](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/save-optimize-and-publish/frame-budget-boost) is enabled, Application Space Warp (ASW) will adaptively turn on to boost
performance as long as the world meets a minimum of 45 FPS without hitching (missing
multiple frames). When ASW is active, the target will double for several
metrics, including CPU and GPU. When not active, the target will return to its original
value.
|  |
|  |
| FPS | FPS stands for frames per second. This metrics measures how many frames the device is able to process per second. Ideally the goal is to display 72 frames per second. |
| Frame Time | The time it takes to process a single frame, in milliseconds. |
...
...
# Enabling and modifying the real-time metrics panel in VR
...
## Real-time Metric Descriptions
...
| CPU | The CPU metric measures how long the CPU took to process the last frame in milliseconds. The higher the CPU number, the longer a frame took to process. If the CPU takes too long to process a frame, it could affect your FPS. When Application Space Warp is on, the target value for CPU is doubled, so you have more usable CPU budget before FPS is affected. |
| GPU | GPU measures how long the scene took to render. Some common things that can negatively impact the GPU performance include complex geometry, expensive materials, complex particles, or many high resolution textures. When Application Space Warp is on, the target value for GPU is doubled. |
...
...
# Enabling and modifying the real-time metrics panel in VR
...
## Real-time Metric Descriptions
...
| Physics | Measures the time spent on processing physics related actions. For example if you have 100 spheres dynamically rolling about while colliding with each other, your physics process time per frame might be high. Having too many triggers in a scene can also add to the overall physics cost. |
| Scripting | Measures the time spent processing scripts written by the creator. |
| Audio | Measures how long the CPU took to process audio events and objects. |
| Avatar | Measures the time spent processing avatar related code. |
| Draw calls | All of the render objects in the scene are gathered by the CPU and then sorted. If you have 200 objects in a scene that does not mean you will have 200 draw calls. Objects that share settings (like using the same geometry and material) will be batched together as a single draw call. |
...
...
# Enabling and modifying the real-time metrics panel in VR
...
## Real-time Metric Descriptions
...
| Vertices | Records the total number of vertices rendered for a frame. A scene with models that have high number verts in them could negatively impact the GPU render time. |
| WaitForGPU | This is the time it takes to synchronize the CPU and GPU each time a new frame is started. This metric can be negatively impacted if the GPU was given more work than it could process in a single frame. |
| Memory | Measures amount of memory currently in use, in MB. This must not exceed the OS-defined limit of 6.25 GiB, so it would be useful to set a lower Target number in order to trigger an alert when you approach the limit. You can keep this metric in check by exercising Memory Best Practices . |
...
...
# Enabling and modifying the real-time metrics panel in VR
...
## Real-time Metric Descriptions
...
| App Space Warp | Frame Budget Boost must be enabled for ASW to adaptively turn on. A value of 0 means ASW is off, a value of 1 means AWS is on. When ASW is on, the number of milliseconds of work your world can do per-frame is nearly doubled. |
| Phase Sync | The additional wait time (in milliseconds) added in between frames to ensure your world runs smoothly. Phase sync time is a buffer that shrinks or expands to accommodate CPU load. As CPU time gets longer and closer to the target time to hit 72 FPS (13.8 milliseconds by default, higher if Application Space Warp is on), phase sync time gets shorter. A consistent and long phase sync time means your world is performing well and is able to generate frames faster than the device’s FPS. A phase sync time of 0 ms may indicate your world is running below 72 FPS. |

# Enabling and modifying the real-time metrics panel in VR

 This topic covers how to access real-time metrics and download performance
traces in virtual reality. For information on how to access real-time metrics and
download performance traces in web and mobile, see [Using performance tools from web and mobile](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/performance-best-practices-and-tooling/performance-tools/using-performance-tools-from-web-and-mobile/). Note: The [Utilities menu must be enabled](https://developers.meta.com/horizon-worlds/learn/documentation/performance-best-practices-and-tooling/performance-tools/enable-the-utilities-menu/) before continuing. The Real-time metrics panel provides real time performance data for metrics like FPS, CPU, GPU,
scripting, and physics. The panel moves as the player moves as it is attached to the
player’s space. To see a list of the metrics you can use, see Real-time Metric Descriptions.
